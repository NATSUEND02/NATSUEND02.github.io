# ProyectoFinal-CodoACodo

This project was developed by the students Ana Kuenneth, Hector Tula and Ignacio Mola Olivera to fulfill the tasks described in the "TPO Desarrollo Web HTML, CSS y Javascript" for the course "Codo a Codo - 23030 - Pyhton FullStack" Imparted by Engineer Anderson Ocana.

You may see the website in action here: https://natsuend02.github.io/

### Description

The project aims to give more life to the https://brahma.com.ar/ website and make it userfriendly while also inviting the consumer to know more about the brand and beer itself.
While maintaining certain aspects of the already existing website to not make it differ far too much.

It contains a home page, a brief recap of the brand's history, showcases of the different kind of beers, an event page where the user can find information of upcoming events or giveaways, a page with news related to beer for the website's country and a contact form for the user to talk directly to the brand.


### Contributions

Ana Kuenneth: Header, Home/index, Cervezas and Cervezas's subpages
Ignacio Mola Olivera: Header, Footer, Origen and Noticias
Hector Tula: Eventos and Contacto


### Issues

- The home page's style and functionability is affected by the Bootstrap used for the carrousel
- The Noticias page's API consumption is bound to HTTP format due to https://mediastack.com/product free subscription plan limitations, allow insecure content in your browser's settings to allow the API to be consumed. (May block insecure content immediately after refreshing the page once)
